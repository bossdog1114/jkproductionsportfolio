    <p class="intro">About Me<p>
        <hr>
    <p class="aboutpar">I'm a Multimedia designer/ Co-host/ and Producer at <a href="http://mondaylovepodcast.com/index.html" class="monday">Monday Love Podcast</a>.  I also design for JK Multimedia Productions/ Bossdog Studios. I previously worked / designer at Mosaic and A Cut Above the Best as UX/UI and Multimedia designers. Feel free to contact me to collaborate. </p>

        <p class="aboutpar">I view all design for its integration of utility and beauty. I believe design plus technology has boundless potential to elevate the human experience. Tech has connected me to the world in significant ways, and has always inspired me to create. I want to be part of that story and give back with the magic that Iâ€™ve experienced, to enrich the greater good and future generations by transforming our present. </p>
        
        <p class="aboutpar">In my free time I enjoy coaching sports with my children; I coach everything including baseball, softball, basketball, and wrestling.  I have coached for almost 20 years incorporating team building skills, hard work, and imbedding seeds in children to influence them with the appropriate tools to be successful in life; teaching them the same work ethic that I have learned throughout my professional career. </p>
        
        <p class="aboutpar">Some other skills that I have been taught are being an audio engineer; recording artists in studio, to voice over on documentaries, to folly work on video games. This tool really works well with my multimedia design making me a more flexible artist/designer. I also produce podcasts and record albums with artists from all across the country.</p>
